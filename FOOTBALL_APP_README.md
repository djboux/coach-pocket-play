### Mock Backend API
The app includes a complete mock API service (`src/services/mockApi.ts`) that simulates your FastAPI backend contract:

```typescript
// Matches your exact API specification
GET /health ‚Üí {status: "ok"}
GET /session/today?child_id={id}&equipment={type}&ignore_recent={bool}
POST /feedback (body: {child_id, drill_id, rating})
GET /parent/summary?child_id={id}
GET /debug/feedback?child_id={id}&drill_id={id}
```

### Data & Logic
- **15 Real Drills**: Complete with instructions, YouTube links, and skill progression
- **Progression Algorithm**: Implements your exact requirements:
  - Easy ‚Üí Level +1 (max 7)
  - Hard ‚Üí Level -1 (min 1) 
  - Right ‚Üí Same level twice, then +1
- **Variety System**: Avoids recent drills unless ignore_recent=true
- **Streak Logic**: Tracks consecutive training days
- **Skill Categories**: Ball Control, Dribbling, Passing with individual progression

## üöÄ How to Use

### Getting Started
1. Enter child's name
2. Select equipment (ball only or ball + cones)
3. Tap "Get Today's Session"

### Training Flow
1. View 3 drill cards with instructions and "why it matters"
2. Complete each drill and rate difficulty
3. Watch progress bar fill as you complete drills
4. Celebrate completion with encouraging messages

### Progress Tracking
- **History**: View last 7 training sessions with drill ratings
- **Parent Dashboard**: See streak, feedback distribution, skill progression, and personalized recommendations

### Debug Features
- Toggle "ignore recent" to test progression logic
- View raw feedback data for testing

## üéÆ Interactive Demo Features

### Testable Scenarios
1. **Equipment Filtering**: Switch between ball-only and cones to see different drills
2. **Progression Testing**: Rate drills as "easy" and reload session to see level increases  
3. **Variety System**: Complete a session, then start new one to see different drills
4. **Streak Building**: Train multiple days to build streaks and see parent insights
5. **Parent Analytics**: View comprehensive progress tracking and recommendations

### Sample Data
- Pre-loaded with 15+ football drills across 3 skill categories
- Realistic progression levels (1-3 implemented, expandable to 7)
- YouTube video links for each drill (placeholder URLs)
- Skill-appropriate equipment requirements

## üîÑ Ready for FastAPI Integration

The app is designed to seamlessly connect to your FastAPI backend:

1. **Replace Mock API**: Simply update the API calls in `mockApi.ts` to use fetch() calls to your FastAPI endpoints
2. **Exact Contract Match**: All request/response formats match your specification
3. **Error Handling**: Toast notifications ready for real API error responses
4. **Local Storage**: Currently used for persistence, easily replaceable with real backend
